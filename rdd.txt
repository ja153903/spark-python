    spread out among a cluster of computers that may or may not be running locally
Dataset
    we have data to work with (really big dataset)

We can use RDD to transform the datset

SparkContext:
    Created by your driver program
    is responsible for making RDD's resilient and distributed
    Creates RDD's
